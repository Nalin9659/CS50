2. Some people have a habit of lecturing speaking rather quickly, and it’d be nice to slow them down, 
  a la YouTube’s 0.75 playback speed, or even by having them pause between words.

3.  implement a function called convert that accepts a str as input and returns that same input with any :) converted to 🙂 (otherwise known as a slightly smiling face) 
and any :( converted to 🙁 (otherwise known as a slightly frowning face). All other text should be returned
unchanged.

 In a file called playback.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and 
 then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).

 4. In a file called einstein.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an
  integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. 
  Assume that the user will input an integer

  // problem 1

  1. implement a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, 
  the Universe and Everything, outputting Yes if the user inputs 42 or (case-insensitively) forty-two or forty two. 
  Otherwise output No.

 2. In a file called bank.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts
    with “hello”, output $0. If the greeting starts with an “h” (but not “hello”), output $20. Otherwise, 
    output $100. Ignore any leading whitespace in the user’s greeting, and treat the user’s greeting case-insensitively.
